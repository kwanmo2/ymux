# ymux

**English** | [한국어](./README.ko.md) | [日本語](./README.ja.md)

A lightweight, tmux-inspired terminal multiplexer for Windows.

Built with Tauri 2 (Rust) + WebView2 + xterm.js. Designed to stay small, fast, and
native on Windows while giving you saved layouts, per-pane working directories
and startup commands, a pluggable shell picker (cmd / PowerShell / pwsh / Git
Bash / WSL), and numbered workspaces that each remember their own layout.

## Features

- **Layouts that persist**: recursive horizontal / vertical splits. Each pane
  remembers its shell, `cwd`, and an optional startup command.
- **Shell auto-detection**: scans the system for `cmd.exe`, Windows PowerShell,
  PowerShell 7 (`pwsh`), Git Bash, and WSL distros, and exposes them as
  selectable profiles.
- **Numbered workspaces**: `Ctrl+1` .. `Ctrl+9` switch between workspaces.
  Every workspace saves its own layout. Panes stay alive across switches
  (tmux-style) so your REPLs and tails don't die.
- **Lightweight**: Tauri binary + WebView2. Installer target < 10 MB.

## Development

Requires: Rust (stable), Node 20+, pnpm (or npm).

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev          # run in dev mode
pnpm tauri build        # produce Windows installer (run on Windows)
```

On non-Windows hosts the Rust crate still `cargo check`s cleanly so you can work
on cross-platform logic from Linux/macOS, but a full `tauri build` and end-to-end
PTY verification must be done on Windows.

## Config

`%APPDATA%\ymux\config.toml` stores workspaces, layouts, and cached shell
profiles. It is rewritten on every structural change (debounced) and on app
close.

## Keyboard

| Shortcut            | Action                    |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| `Ctrl+Shift+D`      | Split horizontally        |
| `Ctrl+Shift+-`      | Split vertically          |
| `Ctrl+Shift+W`      | Close focused pane        |
| `Ctrl+Tab`          | Cycle pane focus          |
| `Ctrl+1` .. `Ctrl+9`| Switch workspace          |
| `Ctrl+Shift+N`      | New workspace             |

## Status

Early MVP. See `docs/` (TBD) for the roadmap.

## Support

If ymux is useful to you, consider buying me a coffee — it keeps the project
moving.
